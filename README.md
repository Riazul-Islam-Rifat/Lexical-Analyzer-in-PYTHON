# Lexical-Analyzer-in-Python
Lexical analysis is the first phase of a compiler. It takes the modified source code from language preprocessors that are written in the form of sentences. The lexical analyzer breaks these syntaxes into a series of tokens, by removing any whitespace or comments in the source code to find the correct pattern. And here I have programmed a lexical analyzer in python that takes a "C code" as an input and finds all the numerical values, identifiers, keywords, math operators, logical operators from input.
